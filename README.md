## 📌 **Overview**  
This project helps **NEET aspirants** track their performance and **predict their potential NEET rank** based on quiz data. It also suggests **medical colleges** where the student is most likely to secure admission.

## 🔢 **How It Works**  

### 📥 **1. Data Collection**  
- Retrieves **historical & current quiz data** via APIs.  
- Extracts **score, accuracy, speed, and question-wise response patterns**.  

### 📊 **2. Rank Prediction Algorithm**  
- Uses past quiz scores and a scoring model to **estimate NEET rank**.  
- Computes an **adjusted "better than" score** to predict ranking.  

### 🏫 **3. College Recommendation Algorithm**  
- Maps the predicted rank to a **college dataset** (Rank vs. College List).  
- Adjusts the **margin of error** to suggest nearby colleges.
